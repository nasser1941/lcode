## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-28

First public release.

### Added

- Interactive terminal agent with streaming markdown output, reasoning display, `@file` attachments,
  slash commands, a status bar and resumable sessions (`lcode -c`).
- One-shot mode for scripts: `lcode -p "..."`.
- Tools for the model: `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file` (with diff previews and a
  whitespace-tolerant fallback), `list_dir`, `glob`, `grep` (ripgrep with a pure-Python fallback),
  `bash` (live output, timeouts, persistent working directory) and `todo_write`.
- Permission modes `ask`, `auto-edit` and `yolo` (Shift+Tab cycles), with a read-only command
  allowlist and "always allow" per command.
- Model catalog with eight open-weight models, hardware detection for Linux + NVIDIA and Apple
  Silicon Macs, and memory-fit estimates that pick the largest context window that fits.
- `lcode setup` (recommend, download and configure a model), `lcode models`, `lcode doctor` and
  `lcode config`.
- Choice of context window per run (`--context 128k`), per session (`/ctx`) or in the config file.
- Text-only model variants that drop unused vision projectors to free GPU memory.
- Automatic conversation compaction when the context window is 85% full, plus `/compact`.
- `AGENTS.md` project instructions and `/init` to generate them.
- One-line installer for Linux and macOS.
